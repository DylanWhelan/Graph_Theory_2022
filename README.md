# Graph_Theory_2022
Hello, this is my repository containing my Jupyter notebooks for my Graph Theory project for the ATU Software Design and Program Development 6th semester.
In this repository are two Jupyter botebooks, one containing my research and analysis of the Heap Sort algorithm and an implementation of it in Python.
And the other contains my research on the graph isomorphism problem, and examples of how graphs can be represented by matrixes.

To run the notebooks, you will need to have Python and Jupyter Notebooks installed on your system, as well as github.
You will need to clone the repository to a folder on your computer, and you can then start up Jupyter and locate the repository to open the notebooks.
